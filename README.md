# BingeBox
This project is a fully responsive Netflix-inspired homepage built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to mimic the original Netflix user experience with modern styling, interactive hover effects, smooth animations, and embedded media elements. It features a clean layout that adapts to various screen sizes, custom typography from Google Fonts, and minimal JavaScript for toggling FAQs. The interface replicates Netflixâ€™s sleek visual aesthetic while remaining lightweight and framework-free, making it ideal as a front-end practice project to showcase layout design, responsiveness, and user engagement techniques using only native web technologies.
